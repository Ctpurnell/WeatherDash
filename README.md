# WeatherDash

## Description


- We wanted a web page that you could search for the current weather for the City selected. Also, we wanted to be able to forecast the next five days. 
- This would be great for trip or event planning.
- This solves the problem of not knowing what the wather will be. 
- What we learned was  that using a combination of HTML and javaScript, using template literals, we are able to view data on a web page.


## Installation

Navagate to [https://ctpurnell.github.io/WeatherDash/] and type the City you are searching for.
